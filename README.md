# Application Title: _Lights Out!_

## Other information

_This application's goal is to help the user have a better bedtime routine, featuring a tips page 
about getting a good nights rest and putting away devies / light distractions with
links to the sources for the tips, a measurement button that takes in the light sensor reading, 
and makes some sort of boolean decision based upon light thresholds I decided and documented why I 
decided those specific values in my code, and then tells the user whether their environment is 
too bright or not, and gives tips to alter their environment to be more suitable for bedtime. 

## Configuration Settings

_Need to be connected to network for best results (in order to get links working), use Android emulator 
to modify the virtual sensors (light sensor) to test thresholds for light (above or below 400 lux)
All code citations follow the form "CITATION:" and are follow by descriptions and links of citation

This application was my own personal creation for a final project for Interaction Computing 
using Android App development for CSE 340 at UW, and is my own personal work to share.
