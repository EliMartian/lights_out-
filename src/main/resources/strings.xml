    <string name="tips_info_2">Use artificial tears to lubricate your eyes
        when they feel dry.</string>
    <string name="tips_info_3">Keep your distance. Sit about 25 inches
        or at arm’s length from
        your screen and adjust its height so you’re looking slightly downward at it.</string>
    <string name="tips_info_4">Reduce glare and brightness. Devices with
        glass screens can cause glare.To reduce glare, consider a matte
        screen filter for your device. Adjusting the brightness
        and contrast of your screen and dimming the lighting near your screen can
        also help reduce eye strain.</string>
    <string name="tips_info_5">Wear eyeglasses. If you wear contact lenses,
        you already know they can increase dryness and irritation.
        To reduce these symptoms, try wearing eyeglasses instead
        when working on a computer for longer periods.</string>
